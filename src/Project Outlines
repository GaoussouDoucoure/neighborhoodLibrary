You will build an application for your Neighborhood Library. The
library is a free service to anyone in your neighborhood and is based
on the honor system. Anyone can check out a book, they just enter
their name and the application will track who checked it out.
Create a new GitHub project named neighborhood-library and
clone it to your workshop’s directory.
Read all the project requirements before you begin to code. Use
your notebook to design and plan your project.
Remember to commit and push your code frequently (at minimum
twice a day).
